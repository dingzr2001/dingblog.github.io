<h3 id="Dictation">Dictation:</h3>
<p>T: I have some good news for you. One of the students who has signed up for the summer term at the field station next year won’t be attending after all. Your name’s first on the WL, so if you still want to do it, the space is available.</p>
<p>S: Oh, that’s terrific.</p>
<p>T: You are also interested in doing independent research project next summer right?</p>
<p>S: Yes, on salt marsh restoration, but that was before, when I thought I wouldn’t get into the field station.</p>
<p>T: Well, you can still do it if you want. I looked over your application for the independent research project and it looks strong. I approved it. And you’d have even more resources there at the field station so</p>
<p>S. The field station and the independent study…but the summer term is a few weeks shorter than a regular term.</p>
<p>T. Well it’s up to you. You’d have to work hard, but I think you can do very well. Professor G, one of the professors over the field station,</p>
<p>S: Yeah, I’ve heard of him.</p>
<p>T: Yes, well, professor G has been doing research on salt marsh for years, assessing human impact and salt marsh restoration. He’s willing to oversee your project.</p>
<p>S: Wow, that’s too good an opportunity to pass off.</p>
<p>T: I saw you’d say that. When I talked to prof.G, he suggested that you take a particular course he’d be teaching here in spring. It’s called advanced topic on salt marsh management. The course looks into salt marsh ecology in depth, and it also focus on factors that stress salt marsh system and how to assess and monitor the level of stress.</p>
<p>S: And that background information will feed right into my research on salt marsh restoration. This is so great.</p>
<p>T. Oh, one more thing. Do you know J.A.?</p>
<p>S; Not really, but he lives in my dorm. Why?</p>
<p>T: J’s another ecology student who will be at the field station next summer. I approved an independent research project for him too. Initially he had the same concern as you, but anyway his topic will be similar to yours. He’ll be researching how bridges and <s>coverts</s> <strong>culverts</strong> that have been installed to allow tidal water to move underneath roads between the sea and salt marshes. Well, they are often too small.</p>
<p>S: I guess that’s the result of not enough tidal water flowing into marshes to maintain natural vegetation, right?</p>
<p>T: Exactly, and he’ll be working on how to determine the right size. So, I was thinking that he might be a good choice of summer roommate for you.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>succulent</strong>: juicy; having leaves and stems that are thick and contain a lot of water多汁的</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Dictation-2">Dictation</h3>
<p>Many organisms have developed the ability to survive in harsh environmental conditions, extreme heat or cold, or very dry conditions. Like, plants in the desert. Your textbook doesn’t have much about this on-desert plants, but I think desert plants are great examples for specialized adaptation to extreme environmental conditions. So, with desert plants, there are basically three different adaptive strategies. And I should point out that these strategies are not specific to any particular species. Many different species have developed each of the adaptations.</p>
<p>So, first off, there are succulent plants. There are many different species of succulent plants, but they all can absorb and store a lot of water. Obviously, opportunities to get water in deserts are few and far between. Generally rains are light and short, so the rain doesn’t seep too far down the soil. And there’s a limited window of time for any plants to get the water before it evaporates. But succulent plants have a spread-out and shallow root system that can quickly pull in water from the soil, though the soil has to be saturated since succulent plants aren’t good at absorbing water from soil that is only a little moist. Succulent plants are also well suited to retaining water, important in an environment where rainy days are very rare. Succulent plants can store water in their leaves, in their stems or in their roots. And to keep that water from evaporating in the sun, many succulent plants have a waxy out layer that makes them almost waterproof when the S<strong>stomates</strong> are closed. They also preserve water by minimizing their surface area. The more a plant is out in the sun, the more potential there is to lose water. And that means most succulent plants have few, if any, leaves.</p>
<p>Now besides succulent plants, there are also drought-tolerant plants. DT plants are like bears in a way. You know how the bears usually sleep through the winter? They can survive without eating because their metabolism slows down. Well, DT plants also go into a dormant state when resources, in their case, water, run short. A DT plant can actually dry out without dying. I said before that most desert rains are short and light, but occasionally there is a heavy one. DT plants revive after one of these significant rainfalls. And there are able to absorb a great bit of the rainfall due to their deep root. Actually the root system for a DT system is more extensive than the root system for plants that live in a wetter climate. DT plants can even absorb water from relatively dry soil because of their deep roots, in contrast to succulent plants.</p>
<p>The third strategy is to avoid the drought conditions altogether. Yes , there are plants that do this-annual plants. An annual plant will mature and produce seeds in a single season that will become the next generation of annual plants. In deserts, an annual grows in fall or spring to avoid the heat of summer and cold of winter. Of course these plants could face a serious problem, if a specific spring or fall is particularly dry. It would have difficulty growing and could die before producing seeds. But they have a mechanism to prevent one year of low rainfall from wiping them out. Not all seeds an annual plant puts out will grow the following year.  Some seeds remain dormant under the ground for several years. It’s a type of insurance to protect the annual plants from a season of poor growing condition, of unfavorable weather.</p>

</ul>
<p>It’s interesting that how much we can learn about culture of the US by looking at how Christopher Columbus has been portrayed throughout the US history. So let’s start at the beginning. Columbus’s ship first landed in the Caribbean,there’s some debate about which island. He landed in 1492, but it wasn’t until 300 years later in 1792 that his landing was first commemorated, and this was the <s>brain S</s><strong>brainchild</strong> of J.P. P was a wealthy NYer, the founder of the NY historical society. And he decided to use his influence and wealth to find a great hero, a patron of the young country, and he chose C. And in NY in 1792, the anniversary of C.'s landing was commemorated for the first time. Now other cities like P and B followed.</p>
<p>S: But why C.? And why then?</p>
<p>T: Well, to P, it was a way to build patriotism in this young, politically fractured country. Remember, the US has only declared its independence from Britain 16 years earlier, and was yet to form a national identity. P also has a hand in helping to create independence day, at July 4th, as a national holiday. So you see, he was very involved in creating a national story for Americans. And C, he felt that C could become a story that Americans could tell each other about their national origin that was outside the British colonial context. The US was in search of national identity, and its people wanted heroes.</p>
<p>S: But why not some of the leaders of the revolution? You know, like George Washington?</p>
<p>T: The leaders of the the revolution was natural candidates to be heroes, but many of them were still alive and didn’t want that job. To them, being raised to a hero status was undemocratic. So C. became the hero, and the link between C and the US took hold.</p>
<p>S: And so what was that link?</p>
<p>T: Well, C. was portrayed as entrepreneurial, someone who takes chances and risks. And he was cast to somebody who was <s>post</s><strong>opposed</strong> to the role of kings and queens. Perhaps most of all, C was portrayed as someone who was destined to accomplish things, just as America was coming to see itself in early years as having a great destiny.</p>
<p>S: But C was supported by the king and queen of Spain. He wasn’t against them.</p>
<p>T: True. To be more precise historically, the way P portrayed C doesn’t match C’s life at all. And I have to stress this. The fact that C  became the hero of a young country has little to do with himself, of what he did, and a lot to do with what was happening to US 300 years later. C was extraordinarily <s>adaptive</s><strong>adaptable</strong> to the purposes of A’s nation builders, people like J.P., in the early 19th century. And since not many facts was known about C, his writing wasn’t available in North America until 1816, that might help the process of adapting him to American purpose.</p>
<p>S: Since no one knew about the real C, it is easy to invent a mythical one?</p>
<p>T: Exactly, and this mythical C became a reflection to the society that chose him. So, in the early history of US, C represented an escape from the political institution of Europe. He was the solitary individual who challenged to the unknown. And there’s the new democracy, the new country in the world without kings. C became sort of the mythical founder of the country. So at the end of this story, we do not want to study these myths and mistake them for facts of C. But if we are trying to understand American culture, we can learn much by how Americans adapt C for their own purposes. Evaluation of C would reflect what Americans think of themselves. Oh, there’s a quote&quot;something like society reconstruct their past rather than faithfully record it and how that reconstruction takes place and what it tells us, that’s something we are going to pay a lot attention to.</p>
